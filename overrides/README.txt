	This is the LibAndria4 /overrides directory. It exists to hold files from
outside of LibAndria4 that are meant to override LibAndria's own behaviors. The
only current option is makefiles, but perhaps some other hooks will be provided
later.
	This file is meant to be the ONLY thing tracked by Git in this directory:
all other files and directories within it should be ignored.
