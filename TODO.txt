LibAndria version 4
TODO:

I only just copied this stuff to my Chromebook, and need to spruce things up:
	Add more abbreviations to stdabbrevs/metaCabbrevs.h.
	Need a proper readme to explain stuff.
	Need to add tests & makefiles for those tests.
	Need to bring in more stuff (e.g. get that rope stuff working, &
		streams/dirs).
	Need to bring in/build some version of LCIS.
	Need to move some stuff (e.g. the error reporter & it's behind the scenes
		printf()-derivative) from MetaC to here.
		E.g. need to move MetaC's char2num.h/.c to LibAndria4.
	monalike_math.h needs to have functions rewritten, because e.g. just( 1 )
		+ nothing() should equal 1, but currently equals 0: this is wrong and
		should be fixed.
		Actually, is that even true? Is this a "square root of -1" thing?
	text_pascalarray.c has a lot of concat operators instead of just sticking
		the sub-tokens together directly: decide if that should be changed or
		not.
	It looks like charsets_EBCDICInvariant.h isn't actually complete.
	Review all of the include guards to see if any are still wrong.
	Review to see if there's still anything prefixed "lib4", or not prefixed
		at all.
	Need to review organization, to see if there's any sensible improvements.
	Move most or all concrete type definitions into commontypes.h.
	Compare commontypes.h's platform detection to platformdetect.h to see if
		it should be e.g. adopted there.
	Add documentation explaining that dirs updating at the time of their
		files updating means that dir builds must be in the root makefiles
		instead of the "normal" makefile.
	Need to rewrite pascalarray.h's initializer macros: you CAN'T initialize
		flexible array members directly with a compound literal. We need both
		a "globals/statics" version, and a initializer function for use inside
		functions. You apparently also can't set them with the "=" operator.
