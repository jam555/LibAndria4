LibAndria version 4
TODO:
	Fully replace the definition of libandria4_failure_result{}
		(basic/stdmonads.h) with libandria4_commonio_err (commonio.h).
		Trying to foist proper typing in was nice and all, but it's really
		just too much hassle. Afterwards, move all uses of
		libandria4_commonio_err to the new definition of
		libandria4_failure_result (since libandria4_commonio_err will be
		superfluous).

I only just copied this stuff to my Chromebook, and need to spruce things up:
	Add more abbreviations to stdabbrevs/metaCabbrevs.h.
	Need a proper readme to explain stuff.
	Need to add tests & makefiles for those tests.
	Need to bring in more stuff (e.g. get that rope stuff working, &
		streams/dirs).
	Need to bring in/build some version of LCIS.
	Need to move some stuff (e.g. the error reporter & it's behind the scenes
		printf()-derivative) from MetaC to here.
		E.g. need to move MetaC's char2num.h/.c to LibAndria4.
	monalike_math.h needs to have functions rewritten, because e.g. just( 1 )
		+ nothing() should equal 1, but currently equals 0: this is wrong and
		should be fixed.
		Actually, is that even true? Is this a "square root of -1" thing?
	text_pascalarray.c has a lot of concat operators instead of just sticking
		the sub-tokens together directly: decide if that should be changed or
		not.
	It looks like charsets_EBCDICInvariant.h isn't actually complete.
	Review all of the include guards to see if any are still wrong.
	Review to see if there's still anything prefixed "lib4", or not prefixed
		at all.
	Need to review organization, to see if there's any sensible improvements.
	Move most or all concrete type definitions into commontypes.h.
	Compare commontypes.h's platform detection to platformdetect.h to see if
		it should be e.g. adopted there.
	Add documentation explaining that dirs updating at the time of their
		files updating means that dir builds must be in the root makefiles
		instead of the "normal" makefile.
