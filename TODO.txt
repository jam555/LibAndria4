LibAndria version 4
TODO:

I only just copied this stuff to my Chromebook, and need to spruce things up:
	To match the name change, need to fill in stdabbrevs/metaCabbrevs.h with
		relevant abbreviations so the identifier lengths are tolerable.
	Need a proper readme to explain stuff.
	Need to add tests & makefiles for those tests.
	Need to bring in more stuff (e.g. get that rope stuff working, &
		streams/dirs).
	Need to bring in/build some version of LCIS.
	Need to move some stuff (e.g. the error reporter & it's behind the scenes
		printf()-derivative) from MetaC to here.
	monalike_math.h needs to have functions rewritten, because e.g. just( 1 )
		+ nothing() should equal 1, but currently equals 0: this is wrong and
		should be fixed.
		Actually, is that even true? Is this a "square root of -1" thing?
	text_pascalarray.c has a lot of concat operators instead of just sticking
		the sub-tokens together directly: decide if that should be changed or
		not.
	It looks like charsets_EBCDICInvariant.h isn't actually complete.
	Review all of the include guards to see if any are still wrong.
	Review to see if there's still anything prefixed "lib4", or not prefixed
		at all.
	Need to review organization, to see if there's any sensible improvements.
	Move most or all concrete type definitions into commontypes.h.
