LibAndria version 4
TODO:

I only just copied this stuff to my Chromebook, and need to spruce things up:
	All of the include guards will be wrong, because I've changed directories.
	Various names need lib4 and similar changed to libandria4 and similar.
	To match the name change, need to fill in stdabbrevs/metaCabbrevs.h with
		relevant abbreviations so the identifier lengths are tolerable.
	Need to reorganize file contents, as some stuff just won't make that much
		sense.
	Need to add copyrights to pretty much everything.
	Need a proper readme to explain stuff.
	Need to add to a commit tracker and push into the public.
	Need to add tests & makefiles for those tests.
	Need to bring in more stuff (e.g. get that rope stuff working, &
		streams/dirs).
	Need to bring in/build some version of LCIS.
	Need to move some stuff (e.g. the error reporter & it's behing the scenes
		printf()-derivative) from MetaC to here.
	platformdetect.h has been skipped in the renaming project: it needs to be
		revisted & fixed.
	monalike_math.h needs to have functions rewritten, because e.g. just( 1 )
		+ nothing() should equal 1, but currently equals 0: this is wrong and
		should be fixed.
