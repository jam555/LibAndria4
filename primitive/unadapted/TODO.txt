Move the long-jump stuff into a "root" platsup directory. Move the platform
 detect & platform support stuff into "root" platdet/ & "root" platsup/
 directories.
The exception & coroutine stuff should both move into "root" platsup/ .
A fallback for stdint.h & similar should be added to "root" platdet/ , so that
 the platform support code can at least be useful on compilers that otherwise
 can't support LibAndria4.
A indirect-inclusion file should be created for platform support and platform
 detect, so that the "make sure the environment is sane" inclusions in sub-files
 will work better without massive risk of things falling out of sync. These
 files should specifically only include the "host" file if the host file's
 include guards HAVE NOT been defined (which means they need to know the
 identity of those include guards, which is where the risk of losing sync comes
 from), and themselves should be included OUTSIDE of any include guards in many
 cases... for reasons I can't immediately remember, but which basically are
 about making certain things get ABSOLUTELY defined/declared in the right order.
