A listing of useful intrinsics:

MSVC:
	_AddressOfReturnAddress: returns the address holding the return address
	__debugbreak: inserts a breakpoint
	__emul: multiply, takes 32 bit vals, returns a 64bit
	__faststorefence: ensures all previous reads & writes finish before further progress; amd64
	__invlpg: invalidates the TLB page associated with the 64bit addr
	_ReturnAddress: provides the addr that will be returned to (see: _AddressOfReturnAddress)
GCC:
	If __GCC_HAVE_DWARF2_CFI_ASM is defined, DWARF CFI directives can be emitted as inline assembly.









Here's some macros:

#if defined(__APPLE__)
#if defined(__linux__)
#if defined(__unix__)
#if defined(WIN32)
#if defined(__MINGW32__)
#if defined(__MINGW64__)
