Add shadow-stack support. It needs to be a sp/bp pair stored in addition to the
 normal stuff. This is for coroutine support. On x86, it's CET.
Another stack-modifier needs to be added for coroutine support, to allow the
 stack and shadow stack to be COMPLETELY swapped out AS AN OPTION, partially
 since not all coroutine variations want to do that.

FIX THE jumpalike CODE TO MATCH THE CURRENT LAYOUT.

Add a alter-return function (must be shadow-stack compatible) in case I decide
 to actually implement the exceptions-via-alternate-return method I've
 brainstormed before.
